Read the [**Hacker News discussion**](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14380191).

## Overview

Fetch Inject implements a Web performance optimization technique known as [Fetch Injection](https://hackcabin.com/post/managing-async-dependencies-javascript/) for managing asynchronous JavaScript dependencies. It works for stylesheets too, and was designed to be extensible for any resource type that can be loaded using [`fetch`](https://devdocs.io/dom-fetch/).

Use Fetch Inject to dynamically import external JavaScript and CSS resources in parallel (even across the network), and load them into your page in a desired sequence, at a desired time and under desirable runtime conditions.

Because it uses [Fetch API](http://devdocs.io/dom/fetch_api) Fetch Inject works alongside [Service Workers](http://devdocs.io/dom-service-workers/) enabling offline-first applications and improving performance in bandwidth-restricted environments.

## Playground

Try [CodePen Playground](https://codepen.io/vhs/pen/MpVeOE?editors=0012). Reference the [Use Cases](#use-cases) to enhance your understanding of what Fetch Injection can do for you.

## Performance

The following network waterfall diagrams were produced using Fetch Inject to load the WordPress Twenty Seventeen theme for a performance talk [given at](https://vhs.codeberg.pagetalks/screaming-fast-wordpress-redis-vultr/) WordCamp Ubud 2017. Stats captured over a 4G network using a mobile hotspot. One shows the speed of the page load with an unprimed browser cache and the other using Service Worker caching. Notice with Service Workers most of the perceived latency with occurs simply waiting for the HTML response to load.

## Syntax

    Promise<Object[]> fetchInject( inputs[, promise] )

### Parameters

<dl>
<dt>inputs<dd>This defines the resources you wish to fetch. It must be an <code>Array</code> containing elements of type <a target="devdocs" href="http://devdocs.io/dom/usvstring"><code>USVString</code></a> or <a target="devdocs" href="http://devdocs.io/dom/request"><code>Request</code></a>.
<dt>promise<dd><b>Optional.</b> A <a target="devdocs" href="http://devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/promise"><code>Promise</code></a> to await before injecting fetched resources.
</dl>

### Return value

A [`Promise`](http://devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/promise) that resolves to an `Array` of `Object`s. Each `Object` contains a list of resolved properties of the [`Response`](http://devdocs.io/dom/response) [`Body`](http://devdocs.io/dom/body) used by the module, e.g.

```js
[{
  blob: { size: 44735, type: "application/javascript" },
  text: "/*!↵ * Bootstrap v4.0.0-alpha.5 ... */"
}, {
  blob: { size: 31000, type: "text/css" },
  text: "/*!↵ * Font Awesome 4.7.0 ... */"
}]
```

## Installing

Fetch Inject is available on NPM and CDN. It ships in the following flavors: IIFE, UMD and ES6.

Save latest minified UMD bundle to a file with [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/):

    curl -o fetch-inject.umd.min.js https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/fetch-inject

Add all three bundles to a [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package:

    yarn add fetch-inject --production

Install the latest `1.7` patch release using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/):

    npm i -p fetch-inject@~1.7

Download the `1.8.1` ES6 module bundle using [`fetch`](http://devdocs.io/dom/windoworworkerglobalscope/fetch):

```js
fetch('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/fetch-inject@1.8.1/dist/fetch-inject.es.min.js')
```

For asset pipelines requiring vanilla AMD or CJS modules see the [Development](#development) section.

## Use Cases

Try the [Fetch Inject Playground](#playground) while referencing the following use cases to enhance your understanding of what this library can do for you.

### Preventing Script Blocking

**Problem:**
External scripts can lead to [jank](http://jankfree.org/) or [SPOF](https://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2010/06/01/frontend-spof/) if not handled correctly.

**Solution:**
Load external scripts [without blocking](https://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2009/04/27/loading-scripts-without-blocking/):

```html
fetchInject([
  'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/popper.js/1.0.0-beta.3/popper.min.js'
])
```

This is a simple case to get you started. Don't worry, it gets better.

### Loading Non-critical CSS

**Problem:**
[PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) and [Lighthouse](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk) ding you for loading unnecessary styles on initial render.

**Solution:**
Inline your critical CSS and load [non-critical styles](https://gist.github.com/scottjehl/87176715419617ae6994) asynchronously:

```html
<style>/*! bulma.io v0.4.0 ... */</style>
<script>
fetchInject([
  '/css/non-critical.css',
  'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/fontawesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css'
])
</script>
```

Unlike [`loadCSS`](https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS/), Fetch Inject is smaller, doesn't use callbacks and ships a minifed UMD build for interop with CommonJS.

### Lazyloading Scripts

**Problem:**
You want to load a script in response to a user interaction without affecting your page load times.

**Solution:**
Create an event listener, respond to the event and then destroy the listener.

```js
const el = document.querySelector('details summary')
el.onclick = (evt) => {
  fetchInject([
    'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/smooth-scroll/10.2.1/smooth-scroll.min.js'
  ])
  el.onclick = null
}
```

Here we are loading the smooth scroll polyfill when a user opens a [details](http://devdocs.io/html/element/details) element, useful for displaying a collapsed and keyboard-friendly table of contents.

### Responding to Asynchronous Scripts

**Problem:**
You need to perform a synchronous operation immediately after an asynchronous script is loaded.

**Solution:**
You could create a `script` element and use the [`async`](http://devdocs.io/html/attributes#async-attribute) and `onload` attributes. Or you could...

```js
fetchInject([
  'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/momentjs/2.17.1/moment.min.js'
]).then(() => {
  console.log(`Finish in less than ${moment().endOf('year').fromNow(true)}`)
})
```

### Ordering Script Dependencies

**Problem:**
You have several scripts that depend on one another and you want to load them all asynchronously, in parallel, without causing race conditions.

**Solution:**
Pass `fetchInject` to itself as a second argument, forming a promise recursion:

```js
fetchInject([
  'https://npmcdn.com/bootstrap@4.0.0-alpha.5/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js'
], fetchInject([
  'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.slim.min.js',
  'https://npmcdn.com/tether@1.2.4/dist/js/tether.min.js'
]))
```

### Managing Asynchronous Dependencies

**Problem:**
You want to load some dependencies which require some dependencies, which require some dependencies. You want it all in parallel, and you want it now.

**Solution:**
You could scatter some `link`s into your document head, blocking initial page render, bloat your application bundle with scripts the user might not actually need. Or you could...

```js
const tether = ['https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/tether/1.4.0/tether.min.js']
const drop = ['https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/drop/1.4.2/js/drop.min.js']
const tooltip = [
  'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/tooltip/1.2.0/tooltip.min.js',
  'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/tooltip/1.2.0/tooltip-theme-arrows.css'
]
fetchInject(tooltip, fetchInject(drop, fetchInject(tether)))
  .then(() => {
    new Tooltip({
      target: document.querySelector('h1'),
      content: "You moused over the first <b>H1</b>!",
      classes: 'tooltip-theme-arrows',
      position: 'bottom center'
    })
  })
```

What about jQuery dropdown menus? Sure why not...

```js
fetchInject([
  '/assets/js/main.js'
], fetchInject([
  '/assets/js/vendor/superfish.min.js'
], fetchInject([
  '/assets/js/vendor/jquery.transit.min.js',
  '/assets/js/vendor/jquery.hoverIntent.js'
], fetchInject([
  '/assets/js/vendor/jquery.min.js'
]))))
```

### Loading and Handling Composite Libraries

**Problem:**
You want to deep link to gallery images using [PhotoSwipe](http://photoswipe.com/) without slowing down your page.

**Solution:**
Download everything in parallel and instantiate when finished:

```js
const container = document.querySelector('.pswp')
const items = JSON.parse({{ .Params.gallery.main | jsonify }})
fetchInject([
  '/css/photoswipe.css',
  '/css/default-skin/default-skin.css',
  '/js/photoswipe.min.js',
  '/js/photoswipe-ui-default.min.js'
]).then(() => {
  const gallery = new PhotoSwipe(container, PhotoSwipeUI_Default, items)
  gallery.init()
})
```

This example turns TOML into JSON, parses the object, downloads all of the PhotoSwipe goodies and then activates the PhotoSwipe gallery immediately when the interface is ready to be displayed.

## Supported Browsers

All browsers with support for [Fetch](http://caniuse.com/#feat=fetch) and [Promises](http://caniuse.com/#search=promises). Because Fetch is a newer Web standard, we will help identify, open and track issues against browser implementations as they arise while specs are being finalized.

## Progressive Enhancement

You don't need to polyfill fetch for older browsers when they already know how to load external scripts. Give them a satisfactory fallback experience instead.

In your document `head` get the async loading started right away if the browser supports it:

```js
(function () {
  if (!window.fetch) return;
  fetchInject([
    '/js/bootstrap.min.js'
  ], fetchInject([
    '/js/jquery.slim.min.js',
    '/js/tether.min.js'
  ]))
})()
```

Then, before the close of the document `body` (if JS) or in the `head` (if CSS), provide the traditional experience:

```js
(function () {
  if (window.fetch) return;
  document.write('<script src="/js/bootstrap.min.js"><\/script>');
  document.write('<script src="/js/jquery.slim.min.jss"><\/script>');
  document.write('<script src="/js/tether.min.js"><\/script>');
})()
```

This is entirely optional, but a good practice unless you're going full hipster.
